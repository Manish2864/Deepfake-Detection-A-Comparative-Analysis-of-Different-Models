# Deepfake-Detection-A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Different-Models

# Problem Statement :- Develop an deepfake detection model capable of classifying videos as either real or fake using different methods and compare the performance of each method.

# Objectives :- 

# 1 Develop deepfake detection models using various architectures and techniques of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

# 2 Evaluate the performance of each detection method in terms of accuracy across video data.

# 3 Predict each  video as real or deepfake.
